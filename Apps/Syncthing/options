# BOOT_ENABLE has 2 options, "no" or "yes", capitalization matters. Default: "no"
# If "no" is selected then Syncthing will not start with system startup.
# If "yes" is selected then Syncthing will start with system startup. No need
# to manually start synthing, but it will consume resources from the system,
# even with wifi off.
# Note: If you have a TrimUI Smart (not pro), you should set this to "no" as the device
# doesn't seem to play nicely with Syncthing starting at boot.
